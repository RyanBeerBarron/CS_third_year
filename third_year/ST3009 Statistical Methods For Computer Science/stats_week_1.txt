1)	a)	10 distinct letters can be permutated in 10! ways
	b)	9 possible places for E or F, multiplied by 2 depending on EF or FE, then 8 others letters permutated 8!, so 8!*2*9
	c)	6! / 3! / 2!
	d)	5 choose 3

2)	a)	6^4
	b)	4 choose 2, ways that the 3s are spread among the 4 rolls, and 5*5 possibilities for the other rolls
	c)	6^4 total possibilities, remove all the rolls without any 3s, 5^4, and remove the rolls with only one 3, 6*5^3

3)	a)	8 cards so 8 permutations, but 4 groups of 2, so 8! / 16
	b)	4*3 / 2
	c)	only can get  H/H D/D and D/H or H/D ( order does not matter )
